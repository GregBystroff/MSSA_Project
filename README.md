# Quantum Resource Tracker
---

Quantum computers are still very much in their infancy, and though Quantum programming is being developed in a few languages, very few resources are currently available and difficult to find. My site is all about providing a central point of reference for those interested in Quantum programming, quantum physics and anything else related to the newly developing industry of quantum computers. 

It would start with a database of the various quantum programming development environments, such as F# and Q# and Microsoft’s Quantum Development Kit (QDK), IBM’s QisKit Software Development Kit (SDK) using Python 3.5, CIRQ from Google, Pennylane, and other efforts that are not yet widely known.

The front page will provide a pleasant staging area where those that wish to learn more about Quantum affects can start their journey by selecting links to the many tutorials and videos on the subject. More advanced users may wish to research development tools, which will have its own database. For those already in the field, code sharing links will be available to those willing to create an account and sign in. 

Future developments will include a chat or messaging feature, such that users can leave messages for each other via the site, or offer bug fixes, comments or other helpful communications about any subject.

There will certainly be events for developers in Quantum programming to gather in person and share, and as those events start to appear, new features will be added to schedule the events, advertising them to all interested parties.

	The site will include a sign-in page but users can continue anonymously with some limitations, such as access to code that was categorized as only available to those that identify themselves. Signing in will also allow for communications between users. This can be done using a federated process where those with a valid account on a highly recognized service will be allowed to continue on the Quantum Resource Tracker using the same account.

	There will be images that link to Quantum videos on YouTube, Quantum papers and articles, others going to quantum training, classes, tutorials, or just take a look at the technology of the industry.

Currently there is one other site similar to this concept. Quantiki.org is a site that is more of a no-nonsense site without imaginative graphical images and targeting Ph.Ds working in the field. My site will be geared towards general coders, regular people with a strong interest in the field. 

The idea being that this will be a site for the many others without PhDs but with high interest and excitement about the industry, looking for an opportunity to play a part in what I believe will be a revolutionary industry.
